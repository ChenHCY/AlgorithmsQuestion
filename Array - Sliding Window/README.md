# Subarray vs Subsequence vs Substring

**Subarray**: A subarray is a contiguous subset of elements within an array. It means that the elements in the 
subarray appear in the same order as they do in the original array. 

For example, given an array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, some possible subarrays would be `[1]`, `[2, 3]`, `[3, 4]`, and `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

**Subsequence**: A subsequence is a set of elements from a sequence (array or string) that maintains the relative order of 
the elements but does not need to be contiguous. In other words, elements in a subsequence may be separated by other elements. 

For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `[1, 3]` is a subsequence, but not a subarray.

**Substring**: A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Unlike subarrays and subsequences, 
substrings only apply to strings, and they are essentially subarrays of characters. 

For example, in the string "hello", some possible substrings would be "h", "lo", and "ell".
