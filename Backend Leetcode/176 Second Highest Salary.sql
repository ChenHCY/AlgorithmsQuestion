/* Leetcode 176. Second Highest Salary
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
 

Write a solution to find the second highest salary from the Employee table. If there is no second highest salary, return null (return None in Pandas).

The result format is in the following example.

Example 1:

Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

Example 2:
Input: 
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output: 
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT MAX(Salary) AS SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary NOT IN ( # 跳过where包含的值 ==> 也就是找到除最高薪水以外的 最大值 (第二高薪水)
    SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee # 最高薪水
)
