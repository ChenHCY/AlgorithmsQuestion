/*Lintcode 747 Â· Coffee Maker OO Design
Description
Can you design a coffee maker, that take a coffee pack, and can simply make a cup of coffee.

Coffee pack contains the recipe of the coffee, like how many milk / how many sugar to be added in the coffee
Coffee maker can make coffee based on the recipe provided by the coffee pack
Only consider 2 type of ingredients: sugar and milk
the cost of Plain coffee is 2. Add one portion of milk/sugar will increase the cost by 0.5
Consider use decorator design pattern

Example:
Input:
pack(2, 3)
makeCoffee()
Output:
Cost for this coffee is: 4.5
Ingredients for this coffee is: Plain Coffee, Milk, Milk, Sugar, Sugar, Sugar
