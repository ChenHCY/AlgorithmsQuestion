/* Lintcode 1181 Â· Diameter of Binary Tree  && 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Description
Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. 
The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree.

Example 1:
Given a binary tree 
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    
Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Example 2:
Input:[2,3,#,1]
Output:2
Explanation:

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
