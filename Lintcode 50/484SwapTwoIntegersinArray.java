/* 484 Â· Swap Two Integers in Array
Description
Given an array and two indexes, swap the integers on the two indices.

Example
Example 1:

Input: `[1,2,3,4]` and index1 = `2`, index2 = `3`
Output:The array will change to `[1,2,4,3]` after swapping. You don't need return anything, just swap the integers in-place.
Explanation: You don't need return anything, just swap the integers in-place.
Example 2:

Input: `[1,2,2,2]` and index1 = `0`, index2 = `3`
Output:The array will change to `[2,2,2,1]` after swapping. You don't need return anything, just swap the integers in-place.
Explanation: You don't need return anything, just swap the integers in-place.
